# Shopping Cart TOP Project

I have been doing this project for quite some time, probably because i was on "vacation" and forgot something a little bit.

Everything looks very simple and has almost no design at all, but it works.

I see that i could do some thing better, such as cart logic and state logic. I still have a lot to improve on and that's good.

What was done:

1. Routes beetwen the pages.
2. Shopping block with items counters inside.
3. Simple cart with all items you added to the cart.
4. "Checkout" and little easter egg if you will try to buy everything :)

What i used:

1. React
2. React Testing Library
3. NPM
4. React Router Dom
5. Tailwind (For the first time, liked it very much)
